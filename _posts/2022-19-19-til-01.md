# Today I Learned #01

Starting this series, I'll share a simple way to filter posts in `Jekyll`, which is the tool that I use to build this site.  

## **Today I learned** - How to filter in Jekyll
Jekyll uses `liquid` as a template language, so we can easily add some logic to our pages. This is an interesting way to share something on a specific subject, like this **Today I Learned** series.

The below example filter post by this tag `today-i-learned` and lists all the posts.
