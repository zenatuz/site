# About me

![Renato Batista](/assets/images/authors/renato_batista_400px.jpg){: .align-right}

Hello, I'm Renato Batista, and I've been working in infrastructure since 2009. My experience spans various sectors, including government, TV, industry, and commerce, both domestically and internationally.

In 2014, I embarked on a unique journey to Timor-Leste, working on a UN mission for their government. During my time there, I had the opportunity to improve my English and discover my passion for traveling.

Since returning to Brazil in 2017, I've been focusing on DevOps, teaching and implementing best practices, experimenting with new technologies, and optimizing digital processes. Currently, I work as a DevOps Engineer in Portugal, where I reside with my family.

I'm an avid lover of technology, coffee, and RPGs, and I'm always ready for new challenges. My interests include video games, sci-fi and fantasy books, movies, and TV shows.

I created this website as a collection of engaging topics about career, life, and change. It's not an obligation, but a source of joy for me. So don't expect daily updates, but feel free to follow me on [**instagram**](https://instagram.com/zenatuz) to learn more about me and my interests.

If you want to know more about my professional journey, please check out my [**linkedin**](https://linkedin.com/in/zenatuz). profile. You can also reach me via email or on other social media platforms. I'd be delighted to chat with you!
